# Personal Finance Responsive Website

#### Description:
Financial literacy is such an important topic in the real world. It's a shame that it isn't taught in schools. This website is meant to start teaching and bringing people into the world of financial literacy. The website allows people to create their own accounts to track their finances and set their goals. 

Upon registering and signing into their new accounts, the user will be prompted with three options, "Track", "Set", & "Invest" on the index.html page. Currently, the "Invest" option (invest.html), is under construction but its functionality would include providing a simple place to hold investment notes and definitions. The main two options would be "Track" (track.html) & "Set" (goals.html). Note these two options can also be accessed using the Navbar at the top. 

The track webpage allows users to add expenses and incomes to gain a better understanding of where their money comes and goes. This webpage can also be accessed at the Navbar at the top of the page under the "Finance Tracker" button. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing all their transactions with the necessary information to get a full understanding.  

The set webpage provides the user with a "Quote of the Day", which pulls from a public API, to help them gain motivation. This page is meant for users to learn about SMART goals and how to set them to achieve them. The brief description and video can always be referenced on this page. Further at the bottom, there is a form with a checklist, this is so the users can create their own SMART goal. The webpage will not save/allow submission of a goal that does not meet all the SMART criteria. Once a SMART goal has been made and submitted the webpage will direct users to the "Table of Goals". This is where they can see all their goals and check them off the list when they have been achieved. Since there are two web pages pertaining to goals, the Navbar button is a dropdown menu allowing users to choose which page they would like to access. 

#### Programming Learned:
This section of the README is meant to explain what was used/learned when building this website. The website uses Python with the Flask framework. For the front end, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used. SQL was brought in to store/query user data and a public API, ninja, was used to access random motivation quotes. Additionally, Chat-GPT was very helpful when it came to reviewing my web pages and helping me learn more about making them responsive. I believe using AI in this manner will bring a lot of success. 

This was my first website built from scratch. I am proud of everything I learned from this project and hope to come back to it later and see my improvement. Whether that is in the aesthetic front end or making a more organized, efficient, and powerful back end.
